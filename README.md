# Drowsiness-detection-and-Alarm
This project aims to detect driver drowsiness using real-time video feeds and alert the driver with an alarm sound . Utilizing machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to classify the driverâ€™s state as either "awake" or "drowsy." Upon detecting prolonged drowsiness, an alarm is triggered to ensure driver safety.
