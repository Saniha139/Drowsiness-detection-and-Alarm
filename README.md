#Drowsiness Detection System with Alarm Alert
This project is a real-time drowsiness detection system for drivers using deep learning and computer vision. It uses a YOLOv5 object detection model trained to identify whether a person is drowsy or awake from webcam footage. If the system detects drowsiness for more than 10 continuous seconds, it triggers an alarm to alert the driver. The alarm stops once the driver is awake for at least 5 seconds.
This solution aims to prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue, especially on highways or during night-time driving.
